        <p>You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern
            enclosed between slashes, as follows:
          </li>
          <code>let re = /ab+c/;</code>
          <p>
            Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular
            expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression
            remains constant, using this can improve performance.
          </p>
          <li>
            Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as
            follows:
          </li>
          <code>let re = new RegExp('ab+c');</code>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the
          regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the
          regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the
          pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Writing_a_regular_expression">
        <header><h2>Writing a regular expression</h2></header>
        <p>
          A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as
          /abc/, or a combination of simple and special characters, such as
          /ab*c/ or /Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/. The last example includes parentheses,
          which are used as a memory device. The match made with this part of
          the pattern is remembered for later use, as described in Using groups.
        </p>
        <h3>Using simple patterns</h3>

        <p>
          Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to
          find a direct match. For example, the pattern /abc/ matches character
          combinations in strings only when the exact sequence "abc" occurs (all
          characters together and in that order). Such a match would succeed in
          the strings "Hi, do you know your abc's?" and "The latest airplane
          designs evolved from slabcraft." In both cases the match is with the
          substring "abc". There is no match in the string "Grab crab" because
          while it contains the substring "ab c", it does not contain the exact
          substring "abc".
        </p>
        <h3>Using special characters</h3>
        <p>
          When the search for a match requires something more than a direct
          match, such as finding one or more b's, or finding white space, you
          can include special characters in the pattern. For example, to match a
          single "a" followed by zero or more "b"s followed by "c", you'd use
          the pattern /ab*c/: the * after "b" means "0 or more occurrences of
          the preceding item." In the string "cbbabbbbcdebc", this pattern will
          match the substring "abbbbc".
          <br />
          The following pages provide lists of the different special characters
          that fit into each category, along with descriptions and examples.

            endings of lines and words, and other patterns indicating in some

        <h3>Escaping</h3>
        <p>
          If you need to use any of the special characters literally (actually
          searching for a "*", for instance), you must escape it by putting a
          backslash in front of it. For instance, to search for "a" followed by
          "*" followed by "b", you'd use /a\*b/ — the backslash "escapes" the
          "*", making it literal instead of special. <br /><br />

          Similarly, if you're writing a regular expression literal and need to
          match a slash ("/"), you need to escape that (otherwise, it terminates
          the pattern). For instance, to search for the string "/example/"
          followed by one or more alphabetic characters, you'd use
          /\/example\/[a-z]+/i—the backslashes before each slash make them
          literal.
          <br /><br />

          To match a literal backslash, you need to escape the backslash. For
          instance, to match the string "C:\" where "C" can be any letter, you'd
          use /[A-Z]:\\/ — the first backslash escapes the one after it, so the
          expression searches for a single literal backslash.
          <br /><br />
          If using the RegExp constructor with a string literal, remember that
          the backslash is an escape in string literals, so to use it in the
          regular expression, you need to escape it at the string literal level.
          /a\*b/ and new RegExp("a\\*b") create the same expression, which
          searches for "a" followed by a literal "*" followed by "b".
          <br /><br />
          If escape strings are not already part of your pattern you can add
          them using String.replace:
        </p>

        <code
          >function escapeRegExp(string) { return
          string.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&'); // $& means the whole
          matched string }</code
        >
        <p>
          The "g" after the regular expression is an option or flag that
          performs a global search, looking in the whole string and returning
          all matches. It is explained in detail below in Advanced Searching
          With Flags. <br /><br />
          Why isn't this built into JavaScript? There is a proposal to add such
          a function to RegExp, but it was rejected by TC39.
        </p>
        <h3>Using parentheses</h3>
        <p>
          Parentheses around any part of the regular expression pattern causes
          that part of the matched substring to be remembered. Once remembered,
          the substring can be recalled for other use. See Groups and ranges for
          more details./p>

        <p>
          When you want to know whether a pattern is found in a string, use the
          test() or search() methods; for more information (but slower
          execution) use the exec() or match() methods. If you use exec() or
          match() and if the match succeeds, these methods return an array and
          update properties of the associated regular expression object and also
          of the predefined regular expression object, RegExp. If the match
          fails, the exec() method returns null (which coerces to false).
          <br /><br />
          In the following example, the script uses the exec() method to find a
          match in a string.
        </p>
        <code>var myRe = /d(b+)d/g; var myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');</code>
        <p>
          If you do not need to access the properties of the regular expression,
          an alternative way of creating myArray is with this script:
        </p>
        <code
          >var myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz'); // similar to
          "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g); however, // "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g)
          outputs Array [ "dbbd" ], while // /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz') outputs
          Array [ 'dbbd', 'bb', index: 1, input: 'cdbbdbsbz' ].</code
        >
        <p>
          (See different behaviors for further info about the different
          behaviors.) <br /><br />
          If you want to construct the regular expression from a string, yet
          another alternative is this script:
        </p>
        '
        <code
          >var myRe = new RegExp('d(b+)d', 'g'); var myArray =
          myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');</code
        >
        <p>
          With these scripts, the match succeeds and returns the array and
          updates the properties shown in the following table.

        <p>
          As shown in the second form of this example, you can use a regular
          expression created with an object initializer without assigning it to
          a variable. If you do, however, every occurrence is a new regular
          expression. For this reason, if you use this form without assigning it
          to a variable, you cannot subsequently access the properties of that
          regular expression. For example, assume you have this script:
        </p>
        <code
          >var myRe = /d(b+)d/g; var myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
          console.log('The value of lastIndex is ' + myRe.lastIndex); // "The
          value of lastIndex is 5"</code
        >
        <p>However, if you have this script:</p>
        <code
          >var myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz'); console.log('The value of
          lastIndex is ' + /d(b+)d/g.lastIndex); // "The value of lastIndex is
          0"</code
        >
        <p>
          The occurrences of /d(b+)d/g in the two statements are different
          regular expression objects and hence have different values for their
          lastIndex property. If you need to access the properties of a regular
          expression created with an object initializer, you should first assign
          it to a variable.

        <h3>Advanced searching with flags</h3>
        <p>
          Regular expressions have six optional flags that allow for
          functionality like global and case insensitive searching. These flags
          can be used separately or together in any order, and are included as
          part of the regular expression.

        <p>To include a flag with the regular expression, use this syntax:</p>
        <code>var re = /pattern/flags;</code>
        <p>or</p>
        <code>var re = new RegExp('pattern', 'flags'); </code>
        <p>
          Note that the flags are an integral part of a regular expression. They
          cannot be added or removed later. <br /><br />
          For example, re = /\w+\s/g creates a regular expression that looks for
          one or more characters followed by a space, and it looks for this
          combination throughout the string.
        </p>
        <code
          >var re = /\w+\s/g; var str = 'fee fi fo fum'; var myArray =
          str.match(re); console.log(myArray); // ["fee ", "fi ", "fo "]</code
        >
        <p>You could replace the line:</p>
        <code>var re = /\w+\s/g; </code>
        <p>with:</p>
        <code>var re = new RegExp('\\w+\\s', 'g'); </code>
        <p>
          and get the same result. The behavior associated with the g flag is
          different when the .exec() method is used. The roles of "class" and
          "argument" get reversed: In the case of .match(), the string class (or
          data type) owns the method and the regular expression is just an
          argument, while in the case of .exec(), it is the regular expression
          that owns the method, with the string being the argument. Contrast
          this str.match(re) versus re.exec(str). The g flag is used with the
          .exec() method to get iterative progression.
        </p>
        <code
          >var xArray; while(xArray = re.exec(str)) console.log(xArray); //
          produces: // ["fee ", index: 0, input: "fee fi fo fum"] // ["fi ",
          index: 4, input: "fee fi fo fum"] // ["fo ", index: 7, input: "fee fi
          fo fum"]</code
        >
        <p>
          The m flag is used to specify that a multiline input string should be
          treated as multiple lines. If the m flag is used, ^ and $ match at the
          start or end of any line within the input string instead of the start
          or end of the entire string.

        <p>
          In the following example, the user is expected to enter a phone
          number. When the user presses the "Check" button, the script checks
          the validity of the number. If the number is valid (matches the
          character sequence specified by the regular expression), the script
          shows a message thanking the user and confirming the number. If the
          number is invalid, the script informs the user that the phone number
          is not valid. <br /><br />
          The regular expression looks for:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            three numeric characters \d{3} OR | a left parenthesis \(, followed

            non-capturing group (?:)

          <li>

          <li>followed by three digits \d{3}</li>
